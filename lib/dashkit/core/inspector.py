"""Health-check runner harness.

Each dashboard registers a list of ``HealthCheck`` objects (name,
description, SQL query, optional params, healthy_when_zero flag) and
the runner executes them with consistent error handling, returning a
dashboard-friendly payload.

Promoted out of a per-dashboard ``inspector_health`` route closure so
any dashkit dashboard can ship its own checks list without copy-pasting
the runner.
