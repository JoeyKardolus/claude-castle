"""SPA shell routes: serve ``inputs/dashboard.html`` + ``inputs/dashboard.js``.

The recorder SPA itself lives in ``inputs/`` (the JS was extracted from the
inline ``<script>`` block, 2026-06-12); this module only serves the bytes.

FAILURE POLICY: nothing to swallow — a missing asset file is a deploy bug
and 500s loudly.
