"""Startup recovery of jobs interrupted by a dashboard restart.

Jobs running on the GPU path own their lifecycle in a K8s Job independent
of this dashboard — a dashboard restart (auto-deploy, secret-sync, OOM)
must NOT poison those rows. Only mark ``failed`` when the corresponding
K8s Job is gone or itself failed. Without this check, every dashboard
recreate killed any in-flight transcription.

``recording`` sessions are NOT touched here: the browser holds the chunks
in IndexedDB, so a re-opened tab can resume the upload. The stale-cleanup
loop (``core/sessions/stale_cleanup.py``) retires those after 6 h.

FAILURE POLICY: the K8s liveness probe fails OPEN (an unreachable cluster
returns "all candidates live", so a flaky kubeconfig never mass-fails rows
that might be progressing); the DB write itself propagates (Tier-1).
