"""One-retry-on-401 wrapper around any kubernetes-client API call.

What is NOT here: the config bootstrap itself — ``ensure_config.py``
owns the kubeconfig dance and the BearerToken alias; this wrapper only
forces a re-load (``ensure_config(force=True)``) when a call comes back
401 with a stale token after rotation. Promoted from ``_client.py`` in
the de-slop campaign: four sibling files imported the private, so the
seam is public now.

FAILURE POLICY: Tier 1 — retries exactly once on 401 and otherwise
propagates ApiException to the caller.
