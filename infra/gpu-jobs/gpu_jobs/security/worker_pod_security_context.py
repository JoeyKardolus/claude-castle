The container-level twin lives in ``worker_security_context.py`` — same
one-home rationale: Job creators (and external Job builders via
``cluster()``) cannot drift on the hardening posture.
Promoted from ``_security.py`` in the de-slop campaign: four sibling
files imported the private, so the seam is public now.

FAILURE POLICY: pure object construction — nothing to swallow.
